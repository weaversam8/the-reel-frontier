# _The "Reel" Frontier_

_The "Reel" Frontier_ was our groups submission for the first "mini-project" for Dr. Arnav Jhala's CSC495-008 special topics course, Computational Visual Narrative, which is crosslisted with Dr. Todd Berreth's ADN560-001 Advanced Animation Studio course.

Dr. Jhala and Dr. Berreth taught this shared course, called "Speculative Past / Speculative Future - A Visual Narrative Project Course". Our first project for this course was a Pachinko inspired game, which we called _The "Reel" Frontier_.

This repository contains the proof of concept code, which is incomplete, but represents our work exploring this artistic space!

**Team Members -** Katie Rant, Sophie DeRosa, Alec Campbell, and Sam Weaver
